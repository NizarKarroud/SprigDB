## About

SprigDB is an experimental, Redis-inspired in-memory database focused on simple dictionary (key-value) data structures. It's an educational and exploratory project intended to demonstrate core concepts of an in-memory store: fast lookups, simple persistence strategies (planned), and small, embeddable design.

This repository is in very early development and not ready for production or testing. No build or run steps are included in this README yet.

## Status

- Status: Early development
- Stability: Unstable / prototype

## Contributing

This project is in its infancy. Contributions that improve clarity, add tests, or implement core data structures are welcome. Opening issues for proposed features or design discussions is encouraged.

If you'd like the README to include badges, a short architecture diagram, or a more detailed roadmap, tell me which and I'll add them (no build/run instructions will be included until you want them).
